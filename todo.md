# Payment Page Implementation Todo

## Files to modify/create:
1. **index.html** - Update Add to Cart buttons to redirect to payment page
2. **script.js** - Add functionality to handle product selection and redirect
3. **payment.html** - New payment page with same theme
4. **styles.css** - Add payment page specific styles (keeping existing theme)

## Implementation plan:
1. Modify existing Add to Cart buttons to store product info and redirect
2. Create payment.html with:
   - Same header/navigation as main page
   - Product summary section
   - Payment form (billing details, payment method)
   - Order summary
   - Same footer and styling theme
3. Update JavaScript to handle:
   - Product data passing between pages
   - Form validation
   - Payment processing simulation

## Key requirements:
- Maintain consistent Voltura branding and theme
- Responsive design matching current site
- Smooth user experience from product selection to payment
